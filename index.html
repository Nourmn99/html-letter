    <p>
        <ul><i>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>).<br>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when <br> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10 <sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10 <sup>4</sup>.) <br>
        Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</i></p></ul>
    <p><i>Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.</i></p>
    <p><i>Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,</i></p>
